    :depth: 4

If you are interested to use the SWIFT storage cluster, please contact the `SURFsara helpdesk`_ (helpdesk@surfsara.nl).



There are two ways to get access. 

- Local SWIFT account through the OpenStack Keystone AuthN service.
  This is what we recommend at the moment unless you have a special reason to use one of the other methods below.
- SWIFT account through the OpenStack keystone AuthN service using you user name and password that is in SURFsara Central User Administration (CUA) system. This is handy for users that use other SURFsara services like the national super computer or the Lisa compute cluster. 

It is also possible to obtain an access key and secret key for S3 access.
